## Problem Statement
 If the illness is common, hereditary, or chronic, we frequently keep the doctor's medications safe in a file. We do this to be aware of our medical background. We don't have to see the same doctor our entire lives, but keeping these records up to date becomes more and more of a hardship as time goes on. In these situations, the majority of patients find it difficult to convey their complete information.Â In order to address the problems listed above and many more, we have created a platform where we can readily access the patient's whole medical history.

## Our Solution
Our approach is innovative in that we would optimize our patients' health by using and leveraging their medical record histories.
The doctor would authorize prescriptions and medical reports on our app, and if we moved to a different location, the new doctor could access all of our prior records by scanning the patient's QR code, which would fetch the information from our database. We can determine which medication or salt composition works best for which patient and which medication could give him an allergy or side effects by reviewing prior medical reports and prescriptions.

## Tech Stack

We mostly utilized javascript for both the frontend and the backend. For the front end, we used a template engine and server-side generatior. For the backend, we use node.js and express. For the database, we primarily use NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Finally, we use elastic search for searching and Auth0 for authentication.
